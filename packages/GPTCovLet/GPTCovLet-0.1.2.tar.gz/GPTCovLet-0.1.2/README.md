# Overview

It's unreasonable for companies to mandate a cover letter when you are applying to many different ones. So this is to help streamline that process.


# Quickstart

pip install GPTCovLet
(Alter login, "desc", and openAI_key, update url with LinkedIn URL, and uncomment completionQuery(url) before proceeding)
python3 GPT_Cov_Let/scrapeToGPT.py
