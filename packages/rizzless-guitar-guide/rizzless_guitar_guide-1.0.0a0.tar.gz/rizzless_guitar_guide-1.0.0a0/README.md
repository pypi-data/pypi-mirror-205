# Rizzless Guitar Guide

This is the first version of the program and the first Python project I created
that motivated me to create this repo. I'm sure there's probably other repos out
there with better and more bountiful information better suited to comb through, 
however, I wanted to create my own to get more familiar with developing in GitHub, 
as well as get more comfortable with Python while studying and creating a tool I 
could use with one hand standing up when practicing guitar (all my fellow guitar 
players out there knows how annoying it can be to have to take off a guitar and 
put it somewhere secure, whether it be a stand or propped up on a bed with a 
pillow rolled up just under the headstock just so you know there isn't any 
unnecessary tension on the neck, all just to be able to move freely when trying 
to navigate through whatever studio setup you got going on). I wanted a personalized 
program/tool that I could use for either the creative process of creating music, or
to use when I'm practicing guitar and need to quickly find something I couldn't 
quite fully recall. This may or may not be a super convoluted excuse I made 
to justify my need for creating something as simple this when other resources exist 
(depends on your way of thinking I suppose). Either way, I hope this first version 
of the program helps to cover any basic music theory questions related to guitar.
