Kiwigrad? yes, it is another version of [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) that was created just for fun and experimentation.

## Install 

To install the current release,

```console
pip install kiwigrad
```

## Kiwigrad Library

Kiwigrad library is a modified version of the [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) package with additional features. The main features added to Kiwigrad are:

* Methods for saving and loading the weights of a trained model.
* Support for RNN1 feedforward neural networks.

### Example Implementation

Here's an example implementation of a MLP net using Kiwigrad:

```python 
from kiwigrad import MLP, Layer

class PotNet(MLP):
    def __init__(self):
        layers = [
            Layer(nin=2, nout=16, bias=True, activation="relu"),
            Layer(nin=16, nout=16, bias=True, activation="relu"),
            Layer(nin=16, nout=1, bias=True, activation="linear")
        ]
        super().__init__(layers=layers)

model = PotNet()
```
