    """LogExportGroup contains an export configuration for a single
    log group which can route logs for a subset of CRDB channels.

        Attributes:
            channels (List[str]): channels is a list of CRDB log channels to include in this
                group.
            log_name (str): log_name is the name of the group, reflected in the log sink.
            min_level (Union[Unset, LogLevelType]):  - UNSPECIFIED: The unspecified log level includes all logs.
                 - WARNING: The WARNING severity is used for situations which may require
                special handling, where normal operation is expected to resume
                automatically.
                 - ERROR: The ERROR severity is used for situations that require special
                handling, where normal operation could not proceed as expected.
                Other operations can continue mostly unaffected.
                 - FATAL: The FATAL severity is used for situations that require an
                immediate, hard server shutdown. A report is also sent to
                telemetry if telemetry is enabled.
            redact (Union[Unset, bool]): redact is a boolean that governs whether this log group
                should aggregate redacted logs. Redaction settings will
                inherit from the cluster log export defaults if unset.
