# About gold-miner

The `gold-miner` tool suite applies a simple statistical analysis of
labeled traffic samples to produce a profile which can then be used to
fingerprint an unknown traffic sample with a goal of rapidly
identifying its contents without requiring deep packet inspection.
Specifically, `gold-miner` is designed to prioritize calculation speed
over higher levels of accuracy that more complex analysis techniques
may produce.

tools, such as `gold-miner-tande`.
