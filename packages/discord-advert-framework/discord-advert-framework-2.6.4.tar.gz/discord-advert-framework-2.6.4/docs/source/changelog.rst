    `Releases <https://github.com/davidhozic/discord-advertisement-framework/releases>`_  

.. note:: 
    The library first started as a single file script that I didn't make versions of.
    When I decided to turn it into a library, I've set the version number based on the amount of commits I have made since the start.

        causing a permanent slip.

        .. figure:: images/changelog_2_1_slippage_fix.png    

            Time slippage correction
