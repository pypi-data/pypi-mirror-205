=======================
Framework control (GUI)
=======================

The framework can be from the GUI controlled with the 2 buttons located on the top left corner of the GUI.

These buttons are called **START** and **STOP** respectively.

**Start** button will, like the name suggest, start the framework. After the framework is running, it initializes
all the provided accounts and starts shilling them. The framework acts exactly the same in GUI mode as it does in
core mode, since GUI is only an extension of the DAF running directly on top of it.

You can tell the framework is running when the buttons change colors:

Additionally you can see the framework reporting successful initialization inside the ``Output`` tab.
