# About
PassionShell is a Bash-like sub-language made in Python for the Passion programming langauge.

# How to Use
In the shell, type `pip install PassionShell`, and in your Python code, `from PassionShell import PassionShell`.

# Functions and Classes
## Classes
PassionShell comes with one class, `PassionShell`. To use it, create an instance of the class, and add this code:
```
from PassionShell import PassionShell
ps = PassionShell()
ps.loop()
```
First, it gets the class and imports it into the local namespace. Next, it creates an instance of the class, `ps`, and finally, calls the `loop` method to continously take input, and execute it.

## Functions
PassionShell currently does not come with any top-level functions.
