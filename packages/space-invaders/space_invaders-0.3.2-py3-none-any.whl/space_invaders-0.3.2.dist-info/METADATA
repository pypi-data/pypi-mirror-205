 - The game consists of phases, you have to survive each phase to  
   complete the level You dont necessarily have to kill all enemies, its  
   enough to dodge them, tho you wont get as much point  
 - There are pickups spawned at random intervals, these pickups make  
   sure to pick them up as they help a lot  
 - Sometimes these pickups are weapons which are way stronger than the  
   default one

 - If you die you start from the very beginning  
 - There are 6 levels in total
