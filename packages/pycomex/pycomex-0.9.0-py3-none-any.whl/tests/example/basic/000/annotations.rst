Description
===========


This experiment will repeatedly create a text made of randomly sampled words.
The words are assembled into a text file, which is supposed to be saved as an
artifact of the computational experiment. Additionally, information such as the
total text length / run time of the calculations are to be saved as experiment
metadata.

This module-level doc string will automatically be saved as the description
for this experiment
