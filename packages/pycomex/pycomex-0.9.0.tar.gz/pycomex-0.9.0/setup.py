Important experiment\nparameters are placed at the top. Actual execution of the experiment is placed within the ``Experiment``\ncontext manager.\n\nUpon entering the context, a new archive folder for each run of the experiment is created.\n\nArchiving of metadata, file artifacts and error handling is automatically managed on context exit.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    # quickstart.py\n    """\n    This doc string will be saved as the "description" meta data of the experiment records\n    """\n    import os\n    from pycomex.experiment import Experiment\n    from pycomex.util import Skippable\n\n    # Experiment parameters can simply be defined as uppercase global variables.\n    # These are automatically detected and can possibly be overwritten in command\n    # line invocation\n    HELLO = "hello "\n    WORLD = "world!"\n\n    # Experiment context manager needs 3 positional arguments:\n    # - Path to an existing folder in which to store the results\n    # - A namespace name unique for each experiment\n    # - access to the local globals() dict\n    with Skippable(), (e := Experiment(os.getcwd(), "results/example/quickstart", globals())):\n\n        # Internally saved into automatically created nested dict\n        # {\'strings\': {\'hello_world\': \'...\'}}\n        e["strings/hello_world"] = HELLO + WORLD\n\n        # Alternative to "print".

It is created as a boilerplate starting\nplace for additional code, which performs analysis or post processing on the results of the experiment.\nThis can for example be used to transform data into a different format or create plots for visualization.\n\nSpecifically note these two aspects:\n\n1. The analysis file contains all of the code which was defined in the ``e.analysis`` context of the\n   original experiment file! This code snippet is automatically transferred at the end of the experiment.\n2. The analysis file actually imports the snapshot copy of the original experiment file. This does not\n   trigger the experiment to be executed again! The ``Experiment`` instance automatically notices that it\n   is being imported and not explicitly executed. It will also populate all of it\'s internal attributes\n   from the persistently saved data in ``experiment_data.json``, which means it is still possible to access\n   all the data of the experiment without having to execute it again!\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    # analysis.py\n\n    # [...] imports omitted\n    # Importing the experiment itself\n    from snapshot import *\n\n    PATH = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent.absolute()\n    DATA_PATH = os.path.join(PATH, \'experiment_data.json\')\n    # Load the all raw data of the experiment\n    with open(DATA_PATH, mode=\'r\') as json_file:\n        DATA: Dict[str, Any] = json.load(json_file)\n\n\n    if __name__ == \'__main__\':\n        print(\'RAW DATA KEYS:\')\n        pprint(list(DATA.keys()))\n\n        # ~ The analysis template from the experiment file\n        # And we can access all the internal fields of the experiment object\n        # and the experiment parameters here!\n        print(HELLO, WORLD)\n        print(e[\'strings/hello_world\'])\n        # logging will print to stdout but not modify the log file\n        e.info(\'analysis done\')\n\n\nFor an introduction to more advanced features take a look at the examples in\n``pycomex/examples`` ( https://github.com/the16thpythonist/pycomex/tree/master/pycomex/examples )\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nThis package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template.\n\n.. _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\n.. _`audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage\n',
