collective.blueprint.usersandgroups's documentation!
====================================================

List of blueprints built to help you import users and groups in Plone.

In source of this package in ``exports_scripts`` directory is also a helping
export script ``plone2.0_export.py`` which provides a external method
``export`` to export data from Plone 2.0 (script might also work with
higher versions of plone 2.1, 2.5, but was not tested) in format that is
suitable for ``collective.blueprint.usersandgroups.*`` blueprints.

And if you might forgot, migration is a bitch ... but somebody has to do it :P
