    Fixed bug where various ORM-specific getters such as
    :attr:`.ORMExecuteState.is_column_load`,
    :attr:`.ORMExecuteState.is_relationship_load`,
    :attr:`.ORMExecuteState.loader_strategy_path` etc. would throw an
    ``AttributeError`` if the SQL statement itself were a "compound select"
    such as a UNION.
