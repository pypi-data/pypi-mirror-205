    Fixed endless loop which could occur when using "relationship to aliased
    class" feature and also indicating a recursive eager loader such as
    ``lazy="selectinload"`` in the loader, in combination with another eager
    loader on the opposite side. The check for cycles has been fixed to include
    aliased class relationships.
