        ### Searches all original pages, databases, and child pages/databases that are shared with the integration.
        It will not return linked databases, since these duplicate their source databases.
        The response may contain fewer than page_size of results.
        See Pagination in api docs for details about how to use a cursor to iterate through the list.

        ---------------
        ### Limitations of search
        The search endpoint works best when it's being used to query for pages and databases by name.
        It is not optimized for the following use cases:
         - Exhaustively enumerating through all the documents a bot has access to in a workspace.
           Search is not guaranteed to return everything, and the index may change as your integration
           is iterating through pages and databases resulting in unstable results.
         - Searching or filtering within a particular database.
           This use case is much better served by finding the database ID and using the Query a database endpoint.
         - Immediate and complete results. Search indexing is not immediate.
           If an integration performs a search quickly after a page is shared with the integration
           (such as immediately after a user performs OAuth), the response may not contain the page.
         - When an integration needs to present a user interface that depends on search results,
           we recommend including a Refresh button to retry the search.
           This will allow users to determine if the expected result is present or not, and give them a means to try again.

        ---------------
        ### Optimizations and recommended ways to use search
         - Search tends to work best when the request is as specific as possible.
         - Where possible, we recommend filtering by object (such as page or database) and providing a text query to help narrow down results.
         - If search is very slow, specifying a smaller page_size can help. (The default page_size is 100.)
         - Our implementation of the search endpoint includes an optimization where any pages or databases that are
           directly shared with a bot (rather than shared via an ancestor) are guaranteed to be returned.
         - If your use case requires pages or databases to immediately be available in search without an indexing delay,
           we recommend that you share relevant pages/databases with your integration directly.

        ---------------
        #### Search Filter Object
        Limitation: Currently the only filter allowed is object which will filter by type of object
        (either page or database)

        ---------------
        #### Parameters
        :param page_size: (optional) The number of items from the full list desired in the response. Maximum/Default: 100
        :param query: (optional) When supplied, limits which pages are returned by comparing the query to the page title.\
                       If the query parameter is not provided, the response will contain all pages (and child pages) in the results.
        :param filter_pages: (optional) sets the `value` key in the Search Filter object to `page`
        :param filter_databases:(optional)  sets the `value` key in the Search Filter object to `database`
        :param sort_ascending: (optional) Limitation: Currently only a single sort is allowed and\
                                is limited to last_edited_time. The default sort is by last_edited_time descending.\
                                If sort_ascending is set to `True`, the default sort will be overridden.
        :param start_cursor: (optional) If supplied, will return a page of results starting after provided cursor.
