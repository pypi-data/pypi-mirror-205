    NEW MARKET ENTRIES—HOW NEW IS NEW?	
	
New-to-the-world products—True innovations that are new to the firm and create an entirely new market (10 percent).	
New product lines—A product category that is new for the company introducing it, but not new to customers in the target market because of the existence of one or more competitive brands (20 percent).	
 Additions to existing product lines—New items that supplement a firm’s established product line. These items may be moderately new to both the firm and the customers in its established product-markets. They also may serve to expand the market segments appealed to by the line (26 percent).	
Improvements in or revisions of existing products—Items providing improved performance or greater perceived value brought out to replace existing products. These items may present moderately new marketing and production challenges to the firm, but unless they represent a technologically new generation of products, customers are likely to	
perceive them as similar to the products they replace (26 percent). 	
 Repositioning—Existing products that are targeted at new applications and new market segments (7 percent). 	
 Cost reductions—Product modifications providing similar performance at lower cost (11 percent)

Market Entry Strategy To be or Not to be?	
With products such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, Microsoft holds a leading share of most office application software categories. But in most of those categories, the firm was not the pioneer. Lotus 1-2-3 was the leading spreadsheet for many years, and WordPerfect and other programs led the word processing category. But as a follower, Microsoft developed improved product designs offering better performance, and it had superior financial resources to aggressively promote its products. Microsoft’s Windows also held a commanding share of the operating systems market, a position the firm could leverage to convince personal computer manufacturers to bundle its applications software with their machines.	
On the other hand, some of the software industry’s pioneers have not fared so well in the marketplace. Lotus, for example, experienced financial difficulties and was ultimately acquired by IBM. 	
Although we have stressed the competitive importance of growth via the introduction of new products, the important strategic question is whether it always makes sense to go first. Or do both pioneer and follower market entry strategies have some particular advantages under different conditions?
