    Market Segmentation
Market segmentation is a process that consists of sectioning the target market into smaller groups that share similar characteristics, such as age, income, personality traits, behavior, interests, needs or location. 
These segments can be used to optimize products, marketing, advertising and sales efforts.
Segmentation allows brands to create strategies for different types of consumers, depending on how they perceive the overall value of certain products and services. In this way they can introduce a more personalized message with the certainty that it will be received successfully. 

Types of Market Segmentation
Geographical Segmentation
consists of creating different groups of customers based on geographic boundaries. 
The needs and interests of potential customers vary according to their geographic location, climate and region, and understanding this allows you to determine where to sell and advertise a brand, as well as where to expand a business.
Demographic segmentation 
consists of dividing the market through different variables such as age, gender, nationality, education level, family size, occupation, income, etc. 
This is one of the most widely used forms of market segmentation, since it is based on knowing how customers use your products and services and how much they are willing to pay for them. 

Segmentatation Objective (4 P's)
Product: Creating successful products is one of the main objectives of organizations and one of the reasons why they conduct market research. This allows you to add the right features to your product and will also help you reduce costs to meet the needs of your target audience.
Price: Another objective of market segmentation is to establish the right price for your products. Identifying which is the public that will be willing to pay for it. 
Promotion: It helps you to target the members of each segment and select them in different categories so that you can direct your strategies appropriately. 
Place: The ultimate goal of segmentation is to decide how you offer a product to each group of consumers and make it pleasant to them. 

Cluster Analysis
Cluster analysis is a techniques for grouping objects, cases, entities on the basis of multiple variables. The advantage of the technique is that it is applicable to both metric and non-metric data. 
Secondly, the grouping can be done post hoc , i.e. after the primary data survey is over. The technique has wide applications in all branches of management . However, it is most often used for market segmentation analysis.

Characterstics of Cluster Analysis
Can be used to cluster objects, individuals and entities
Similarity is based on multiple variables
Measures proximity between  study variables
Groups that are grouped in one cluster are homogenous as compared to others
Can be conducted on metric, non-metric as well as mixed data

Usage of Cluster Analysis
Market segmentation – customers/potential customers can be split into smaller more homogenous groups by using the method.
Segmenting industries – the same grouping principle can be applied for industrial consumers.  
Segmenting markets – cities or regions with similar or common traits can be grouped on the basis of climatic or socio-economic conditions. 
Career planning and training analysis – for human  resource planning people can be grouped  into clusters on the basis of their educational/experience or aptitude and aspirations.
Segmenting financial sector/instruments – different factors like raw material cost, financial allocations, seasonality and other factors are being used to group sectors together to understand the growth and performance of a group of industries. 

Conducting Cluster Analysis
Formulate the problem -> Select distance measure -> Select clustering procedure -> Decide number of clusters -> Interpret and profile clusters -> assess validity of clustering

Conducting Cluster Analysis: Formulate the problem
Perhaps the most important part of formulating the clustering problem is selecting the variables on which the clustering is based.  
Inclusion of even one or two irrelevant variables may distort an otherwise useful clustering solution.  
Basically, the set of variables selected should describe the similarity between objects in terms that are relevant to the marketing research problem.  
The variables should be selected based on past research, theory, or a consideration of the hypotheses being tested.  In exploratory research, the researcher should exercise judgment and intuition. 

Conducting Cluster Analysis: Select a Distance or Similarity Measure 
The most commonly used measure of similarity is the Euclidean distance or its square. The Euclidean distance is the square root of the sum of the squared differences in values for each variable.  Other distance measures are also available.  The city-block or Manhattan distance between two objects is the sum of the absolute differences in values for each variable.  The Chebychev distance between two objects is the maximum absolute difference in values for any variable.
If the variables are measured in vastly different units, the clustering solution will be influenced by the units of measurement.  In these cases, before clustering respondents, we must standardize the data by rescaling each variable to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of unity.  It is also desirable to eliminate outliers (cases with atypical values).
Use of different distance measures may lead to different clustering results.  Hence, it is advisable to use different measures and compare the results. 

K-Means Clustering
Select ANALYZE from the SPSS menu bar.
Click CLASSIFY and then K-MEANS CLUSTER.
Move “Fun [v1],” “Bad for Budget [v2],” “Eating Out [v3],” “Best Buys [v4],” “Don’t Care [v5],” and “Compare Prices [v6]” into the VARIABLES box.
For NUMBER OF CLUSTER, select 3.
Click on OPTIONS.  In the pop-up window, in the STATISTICS box, check INITIAL CLUSTER CENTERS and CLUSTER INFORMATION FOR EACH CASE.  Click CONTINUE.
Click OK.
