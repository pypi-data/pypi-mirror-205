Marketing
Marketing is the process of finding consumer needs and serving those needs profitably. Thus customer is the heart of marketing activities.
Marketing is the process of planning and executing the conception, pricing, promotion and distribution of ideas, goods and services to create exchanges that satisfy individual and organizational goals.”
Definitions of marketing underline following facts
The customer is the center of marketing activities.
Marketing aims at satisfying customer needs and wants and achieving organizational objectives.
Marketing involves series of activities as conception of goods, services, concepts or ideas, pricing these marketable entities, promoting and distribution

Needs, wants & demands  
Needs are basic human requirements. We need food, air, water, clothing and shelter to survive. People also have strong need for recreation, education and entertainment.
Wants are needs directed towards specific objects- e.g. A South Indian needs food but wants Idlis, Dosas & Sambar. A North Indian needs food but wants Rotis, Sabjis etc.
Demands are wants for specific products backed by an ability to pay. Many may want to own Mercedes; only a few are able and willing to pay for Mercedes.
Demand is one of the major premises for planning marketing activities.
Marketers do not create needs, needs preexist wants, Marketer influences wants.

Markets
Traditionally, a market was a physical place where buyers and sellers gathered to buy and sell goods.
Economists now describe a market as a collection of buyers and sellers who transact over a particular product or product class (the housing market or grain market) 
Marketers view the sellers as constituting the industry and the buyers as a constituting the market.
The term market can also be used to cover various groupings of customers such as need market (the diet seeking market), product market (The shoe market), demographic market (The youth market), and geographic market (The Asian market) or the concept may also be extended to cover other markets such as money market, forward market etc.
Depending on the focus of marketer we can classify the markets as consumer markets, e.g. (FMCG markets), Industrial markets i.e. business buyers buying goods in order to make or resell a product to others for profits, non-profit market (organizations like Churches, Non government Organizations involved in social causes etc.) or global (International) market.

Target markets and Segmentation
Market consists of heterogeneous buyers who might prefer or require different product and services. Marketer identifies and profile distinct groups of buyers requiring varying products and services. 
Market segments can be identified by examining demographic, psychographic and behavioral differences among buyers. The marketer then decides which segments present the greatest opportunity, which are its target markets. For each chosen target market, the firm develops a market offering (The combination of products, services, information and experiences).
The offering is positioned in the minds of the target markets as delivering some central benefits for example, Videocon offered electronic appliances for price-conscious customers; and thus positioned as value for money products.

Value and satisfaction
Value can be defined as a ratio between what customer gets and what he gives. The customer gets benefits and assumes cost. The benefits include functional benefits and emotional benefits. The costs include monetary costs, time costs and psychic costs. The value is given as
Value can be seen primarily a combination of quality, services & price (QSP), called customer value tried.




Marketing Channels
Communication channels deliver and receive messages from target buyers, and include newspapers, radio, television, mail, telephone, posters, fliers, CDs, audiotapes and internet.
The marketer uses distribution channel to display, sell or deliver the physical product or services to the user. They include distributor, wholesalers, retailers and agents.
The marketer also uses service channels to carry out transactions with potential buyers. Service channels include warehouses, transportation companies, banks and insurance companies that facilitate transaction.
Marketer must design the best mix of communication, distribution and service channels for those offerings.

Marketing Philosophies
The production concept
The production concept holds that consumers will prefer products that are widely available and in-expensive. Thus the major thirst is on achieving high production efficiency, low costs and mass distributions. The production concept assumes that consumers are primarily interested in availability of product and low prices will attract consumers.
This orientation is appropriate in developing countries where consumers are interested in buying products than features. It is also used when company wants to expand the market.

The product concept:--
The product concept proposes that the consumers favor those products that offer the most quality, performance and innovative features.
The product-oriented organization concentrates on continuous improvement of product and emphasis on quality assurance. They spend heavily on research and development.

The selling concept:-
The selling concept holds that consumers typically show buying inertia i.e. they will not buy enough of organizational products if they are left alone and hence company has to aggressively promote and push its products. 
Company practicing selling concept involve in heavy advertising, high-power personal selling, large scale sales promotion, heavy-price discounts and strong publicity, and public relations. The selling concept is practiced in most aggressively with unsought goods such as insurance, encyclopedias etc. and non-profit areas by fund- raisers, and political parties. The selling concept may also be practiced when firms have over capacity.

Marketing Myopia:--
Prof. Theodore Levitt coined the term “Marketing Myopia” to describe excessive obsession with the product, production or selling and losing the sight of customer in the process. The production concept may lead to compromise in quality for the obsession of low pricing and also understanding what customer values. The product concept is blinded by love for the product and does not understand that customers buy solution to their problems and not product. The selling concept is obsessed with disposition of goods without understanding needs and wants of customers. Such myopia leads to a wrong or inadequate understanding of the market and hence failure in the marketplace.

Marketing concept:-
The marketing concept holds the key in achieving its organization goals consists of company being more effective than competitors in creating, delivering and communicating superior customer value to its chosen target market.
The marketing concept rests on four pillars: target market, customer needs, integrated marketing, and profitability. The marketing concept starts with the well defined market, focuses on customer needs, co-ordinate all the activities that will affect the customers and produces profits by satisfying customers.

Consumer is central for Marketing
The marketing concept does not mean giving the consumer (only) what they want, because:
the consumer’s wants can be widely divergent;
the consumer’s wants contradict the firm’s minimum needs; and
the consumer might not know what they want. It is marketing’s job to learn and understand and incentivize consumer behavior to a win-win position.
“The public does not know what is possible. We do” – Akio Morita

Consumer Behavior
The term ‘Consumer Behavior’ refers to the study of how individuals make decisions to spend their available resources on consumption related items. 
“Consumer Behavior is the process and physical activity individuals engage in when  evaluating, acquiring, using, and disposing of goods and services.” - Louden-Dellabitta



Marketing Strategy
A marketing strategy is a long-term plan for achieving a company's goals by understanding the needs of customers and creating a distinct and sustainable competitive advantage
The critical issue concerning the scope of a marketing strategy is specifying the target market(s) for a particular product or product line. 
Next, firms seek competitive advantage and synergy through a design of marketing mix elements (primarily the 4 Ps of product, price, place, and promotion) tailored to the needs and wants of potential customers in that target market.

Marketing Analytics
Marketing analytics is the study of data to evaluate the performance of a marketing activity. By applying technology and analytical processes to marketing-related data, businesses can understand what drives consumer actions, refine their marketing campaigns and optimize their return on investment.
MA covers models and metrics that provide actionable insights.

Model Styles
Verbal Models
Expressed as words
E.g. “Sales revenues increases with advertising spending up to a point and then fails”.
Pictorial Models
Represent marketing scenario in a diagram
E.g. Demand curve, Howard Sheth Model of Consumer behaviour
Mathematical Model
Represents relationships between variables as mathematical variables
Sales = f(Advertising)
Concept of dependent and independent variables. 
E.g. Controlling or Non-controlling variables- moderating 

Model Types (Forms)
Descriptive Models
Uses historical data to understand what happened in the past to inform future strategies
Just specifies causal relationship between variables 
e.g. sales=a + b * Advertising
Predictive Models
Takes insights from the past and using these insights to create a  more informed marketing campaign
Determines likely outcomes given certain inputs
E.g. calibration of above equation. “What will happen if we reduce price of a product”, What-if analysis
Prescriptive Models
Use data to weigh impact of each course of action that influences outcome
Provide guidance on the appropriate course of actions given certain set of circumstances
Goes beyond describing or predicting relationships 
     e.g “What is the optimum price for generating maximum profits?”
Most difficult to develop

Metrics
Metrics are measurements quantifying important attributes of marketing phenomena
E.g. “Sales revenues by store”, “Sales revenues by Products”
Used for monitoring and diagnosing marketing phenomena and take actionable insights.

Types of Response Models
By number of marketing variables (one or two variables model)
By nature of the relationships (linear or S-shaped)
By whether situation is static (Cross-sectional)  or dynamic (Time-series).
By whether model reflects individual or aggregate response
By the level of demand analyzed (should we analyze brand sales directly or brand share and market demand whose product is brand sales separately)

Dynamic Effects
Responses to the marketing actions does not take place instantly
E.g. the effect of an ad campaign does not end when campaign is over  - it will continue to stay for some time in some way
Similarly more consumers buy more than they consume of a product during short-term price promotions leading to drop in sales sin subsequent periods.
Carry-over Effect
Influence of a current market expenditure on sales in future periods.
Different carry-over effects:
Delayed-response Effect
Customer-holdover effect (customer retention or Decay rate)
Stocking Effects

Marketing Objectives
Maximize Short-run Profit
Profit = (Unit price – unit variable cost) x (Sales Volume –Relevant Cost) = Unit Margin X Quantity – Costs
Maximize Long-Run Profit
PV= Z0 + Z1r+Z2r2+ Z3R3 …,
Where Z is profit for period i and r=1/(1+d) , with d being the discount rate
Multiple Goals sometimes conflicting
