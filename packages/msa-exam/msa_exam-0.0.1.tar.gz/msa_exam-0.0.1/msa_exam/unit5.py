Relational Marketing
Relationship marketing is a distinct strategy for creating more meaningful customer relationships and boosting brand loyalty, retention, and customer lifetime value.

Benefits of Relational Marketing
Cost-Effective
Marketing efforts to reach new customers and win them over can be costly. Maintaining existing customers through relationship marketing, however, can be highly cost-effective.
Increase Customer Retention
By connecting with your customers, they feel included and part of a special group that benefits from your business and what you have to offer. In turn, these customers are happy to continue interacting with you and purchase your products or services more often.
Improve Your Marketing ROI
Marketing ROI can be a prime indicator of your success. With higher customer retention numbers, the costs of customer acquisition decrease, providing you with a higher budget for building and implementing your relationship marketing strategy.
Increase Sales
Existing customers often return to make more purchases since they already value the products or services you offer. Add to that a higher level of interaction and the building of a relationship, and you can continue to see your sales increase.
Lead to Referrals and Higher Brand Awareness
Happy customers love to share their finds with others, either by word of mouth or online, such as through social media. Consumers often look to referrals and good reviews to take that next step and make a purchase
Boost You Above the Competition
Finding ways to get ahead of your competition and stay there can be challenging today. Relationship marketing can help, creating loyal customers who stay with you and also persuade others to buy from you as well. 

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
It computes economic value of an individual customer  relationship.
It is both backward looking and forward looking
Computing value of past customers 
Using that information to project forward

Application of CLV
To determine how much to spend to acquire a customer
To determine how aggressively to spend to retain a particular customer or group of customers
To value a company 

Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative Filtering is a technique or a method to predict a user’s taste and find the items that a user might prefer on the basis of information collected from various other users having similar tastes or preferences. It takes into consideration the basic fact that if person X and person Y have a certain reaction for some items then they might have the same opinion for other items too. 
The two most popular forms of collaborative filtering are:
User Based: Here, we look for the users who have rated various items in the same way and then find the rating of the missing item with the help of these users.
Item Based: Here, we explore the relationship between the pair of items (the user who bought Y, also bought Z). We find the missing rating with the help of the ratings given to the other items by the user.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: It was first invented and used by Amazon in 1998. Rather than matching the user to similar customers, item-to-item collaborative filtering matches each of the user’s purchased and rated items to similar items, then combines those similar items into a recommendation list. It helps in cross selling.

Market Basket
Market basket analysis is a data mining technique used by retailers to increase sales by better understanding customer purchasing pattern
It involves analyzing large data sets, such as purchase history, to reveal product groupings, as well as products that are likely to be purchased together.
