# UzSyllable

https://pypi.org/project/UzSyllable <br>
https://github.com/UlugbekSalaev/UzSyllable

UzSyllable tool is focused to make division of syllables and end of line breaks of Uzbek language. The tool includes Syllabification, End-of-Line, Count of Syllables methods.
It is created as a python library and uploaded to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). It is simply easy to use in your python project or other programming language projects via the API. 

## About project
The UzSyllable project is a text processing tool that includes three main methods: syllabification, end-of-line, and count of syllables. Syllabification involves dividing words in Uzbek text into their constituent syllables, which can be useful for pronunciation, spelling, and linguistic analysis. End-of-line justification involves determining the appropriate places to break lines in Uzbek text, which can improve the readability and aesthetics of written materials. Count of syllables involves counting the number of syllables in a given word or sentence, which can be useful for metrics such as rhyme and meter in poetry or for determining the complexity of a text. The UzSyllable project uses machine learning algorithms and linguistic rules to perform these methods accurately and efficiently on Uzbek text.

# Output : ['mak-ta-bim-da']
print(UzSyllable.syllables('мактабимда'))
# Output : ['мак-та-бим-да']
# call end-of-line method
print(UzSyllable.line_break('maktabimda'))
# Output : ['mak-tabimda', 'makta-bimda', 'maktabim-da']
# call count of syllables method
print(UzSyllable.count('maktabimda'))
# Output : 4
