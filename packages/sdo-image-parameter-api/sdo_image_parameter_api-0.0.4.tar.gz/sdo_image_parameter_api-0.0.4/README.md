## SDO Image Parameter Python API
### A Toolkit for Accessing Solar Image Data

This project was created to facilitate accessing the Image Parameter Web API 
available at http://dmlab.cs.gsu.edu/dmlabapi/ using a Python package.

## Install it from PyPI
You can install this package using pip: 
`pip install sdoimageparameterapi`

---

## File Structure:

- `sdo_image_parameter_api/image_methods.py` contains all the methods used 
  for retrieving image information. Includes the four accessor methods 
  described in the next section, as well as the 8 private methods that make 
  the calls to the Web API.
- `sdo_image_parameter_api/constants.py` includes all the defined constants 
  for Format, InfoType, Wave, Size, Param, as well as the URLs to retrieve 
  information with the Web API.
- `sdo_image_parameter_api/util/converters.py` includes methods to 
  convert XML ElementTree objects into NumPy arrays.
- `sdo_image_parameter_api/util/validators.py` includes methods to 
  format and validate given time parameters, as well as validate 
  all other inputted arguments.

## Method Options

There are four methods that return different types of image information. 

 * The **get_img_jpeg()** method can be used to return an AIA JPEG image, or a
   JPEG Parameter image. 
 * The **get_img_param()** method can be used to 
   return image parameters of one image of the sun in XML or JSON format.
 * The **get_img_param_range()** method can be used to return image 
   parameters of a range of images of the sun in XML or JSON format. 
 * The **get_img_header()** method can be used to return image header 
   information in XML or JSON format.

The required parameters for each method and how to run them for each type of
output is explained in more detail in the Notebook (src/demo.ipynb)
