# Introduction

DroneSploit is a CLI framework based on [`sploitkit`](https://github.com/dhondta/sploitkit) and is an attempt to gather hacking techniques and exploits especially focused on drone hacking. For the ease of use, the interface has a layout that looks like Metasploit.

Currently, it only supports very few models of drones but we hope to welcome contributions in a near future.

## Setup

This library is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dronesploit/) and can be simply installed using Pip:

```sh
pip3 install dronesploit
```
