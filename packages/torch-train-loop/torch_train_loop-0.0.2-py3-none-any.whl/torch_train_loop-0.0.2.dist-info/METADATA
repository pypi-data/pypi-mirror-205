# jsac's `torch_train_loop`

`torch_train_loop` is a general-purpose train-loop for [PyTorch][PyTorch] models, with some convenient features built-in:
  - Integration with [TensorBoard][TensorBoard] (via PyTorch's [SummaryWriter][SummaryWriter]) for
    plotting:
    - Training loss
    - Validation loss
    - Additional optional metrics
  - Progress bar(s) (via [tqdm][tqdm]) for Jupyter Notebooks or CLI environments.
  - [Early stopping][EarlyStopping] overfitting detection.
