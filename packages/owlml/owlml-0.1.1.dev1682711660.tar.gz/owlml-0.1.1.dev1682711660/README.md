# OwlML

OwlML is a Python package that provides a single Command Line Interface (CLI) for integrating CVAT and ClearML. The goal is to streamline the process of working with these two open-source services, making it easier to manage tasks and resources through a unified interface. Eventually, the project aims to stand up the OwlML API, which will further simplify the interaction between CVAT and ClearML.

## Features

- Unified CLI for CVAT and ClearML
- Streamlined task and resource management
- Planned OwlML API for seamless integration

## Installation

Install OwlML using pip:

```bash
pip install owlml
```

## Usage

As the project is in its early stages, usage instructions will be updated as more features are implemented.
