**Args**

* **scores_x** (NdArray) : A matrix of size (`num_runs_x` x `num_tasks`) where scores[n][m]
    represent the score on run `n` of task `m` for algorithm `X`.
* **scores_y** (NdArray) : A matrix of size (`num_runs_y` x `num_tasks`) where scores[n][m]
    represent the score on run `n` of task `m` for algorithm `Y`.


**Returns**

Comparer instance.
