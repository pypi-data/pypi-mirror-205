# Bosanski Kalkulator

A perfectly normal GUI stack-based calculator.

To enter a number, press the corresponding digits from left to right and finish by pressing the hashtag, which places it on the stack. You can optionally use `(+/-)` to toggle between entering positive and negative numbers.

The arithmetic operators use the 2 top values and returns the result onto the stack.

- `del` clears the typing area.
- `clr` clears the stack.
- `pop` removes the topmost value from the stack.
- `dup` duplicates the value on top of the stack.
- `swp` swaps the first two values on the stack.
- `rll` takes the value from the top of the stack and places it onto the bottom.
