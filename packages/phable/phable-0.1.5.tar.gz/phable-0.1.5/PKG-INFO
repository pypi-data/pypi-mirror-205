About
-----
Phable provides a simple way to retrieve Haystack tagged JSON data from a file or Haystack server using Python.  The retrieved data is reformatted to integrate seamlessly with popular open source Python libraries including, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and more.

Python has evolved during the past few years, having introduced type hints, asyncio, and more.  These enhancements make it easier to read and debug Python code.  To that end Phable is designed using the latest Python features.

Haystack in this context is a reference to [Project Haystack](https://project-haystack.org/), which is an open source initiative to streamline working with IoT Data.  Project Haystack standardizes semantic data models and web services with the goal of making it easier to unlock value from the vast quantity of data being generated by the smart devices that permeate our homes, buildings, factories, and cities.

Installation
------------
Phable requires Python 3.11 or higher and has no other dependencies.  Phable will likely most often be used with other 3rd party libraries and built-in support is provided.  (TODO :  Explain more)

Download Phable from Pypi:

```console
$ pip install phable
```

Quick start
-----------
The below example shows how to obtain an auth token from a Haystack server.

```python
from phable.phable import Phable

# define these settings specific for your use case
# Reminder:  Probably secure your login credentials!!!
uri = "http://localhost:8080/api/demo"
username = "su"
password = "su"

# open a session, execute queries, and simply close
# session with the context manager
with Phable(uri, username, password) as ph:
    ph.about()
```

**More examples coming soon!**

Future
------
Today Phable formally supports read-only data operations.  As this project matures we would like to add more features.

The near-term focus is on making this project easily understood by a Python developer - refactoring the code several times and improving the documentation.  We would love your feedback and contributions!

TODO
----
- Support pandas without requiring pandas dependency
- Improve docs
- Improve tests
- Add more tests
- Factory for serializers
- Explain in the docs that zoneinfo module is used for tz data and may require other dependencies
- Validate the Haystack timezones
- Only provide tests for what is exposed on the API
- Test Coord, XStr, and other kinds over API
- Improve parsing of singletons Marker, Remove, and NA

Questions
---------
 - What version Haystack should I put in the Grid meta?
 - How do we validate the responses meet the Haystack requirements?
