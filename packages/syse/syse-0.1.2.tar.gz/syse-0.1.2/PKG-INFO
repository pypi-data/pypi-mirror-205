SysE is a Python library for Industrial and Systems Engineering.

SysE covers common Industrial & Systems Engineering topics such as:
* Engineering Economics 
* Probability & Statistics
* Modeling & Quantitative Analysis
* Engineering Management


To get started, check out the docs for further information, including how to install SysE and common use cases.

**Links:**
* **Documentation:** [SysE Docs](https://syse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* **Repository:** [SysE Repo](https://github.com/Apex-Engineering-Management/SysE)

**Notes:**

* The linear optimization function is extremely limited, and will be worked on.
* For the few functions that can't be called with scalars, arrays, or other sequences, there are plans to update them.
