- [x] Package dependency management (`merlon add`)
- [x] Experimental GUI support (`merlon gui` when built with `--features gui`)

## Installation

> **Note:** If you use Windows, you will need to use WSL 2. See the [decomp installation instructions](https://github.com/pmret/papermario/blob/main/INSTALL.md#wsl-2) for more information.

See [releases](https://github.com/nanaian/merlon/releases) for pre-built binaries.

### From source

Merlon is written in Rust. To build from source, you will need to install the Rust toolchain. See [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) for instructions.

Once you have the Rust toolchain installed, you can install Merlon from crates.io with:

```bash
cargo install merlon
```

If you have a clone of this repository, you can install Merlon with:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

## Supported platforms

Merlon supports all platforms that the Paper Mario decompilation supports.

- Linux
    - Debian/Ubuntu
    - Arch Linux
    - openSUSE
    - Alpine Linux
    - Nix (nix-shell)
- macOS
- Windows (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2)

See the [decomp installation instructions](https://github.com/pmret/papermario/blob/main/INSTALL.md) for more information.

Additionally, Merlon has a number of runtime dependencies that should be available on your PATH:

- `git`
- `ninja`
- `python3`
- `tar`
- `bzip2`
- `openssl`

## Usage

Merlon is a command-line tool. Use `merlon help` for more information.

A quick tour:

```
$ merlon new "My mod"
$ cd my-mod
$ merlon init
$ touch papermario/src/my-mod.c && git -C papermario add src/my-mod.c && git -C papermario commit -m "add src/my-mod.c"
$ merlon build
$ merlon export
$ merlon apply "My mod 0.1.0.merlon"
```

Example mods can be found at [nanaian/pm-mods](https://github.com/nanaian/pm-mods).

## Mod file format

Merlon mods are packaged as `.merlon` files. These files are encrypted using the original game ROM, and cannot be used without the original game ROM. Unencrypted, it is a BZ2-compressed tarball of git patch files that can be applied to a copy of the decomp source code. Additionally, `.merlon` files contain only source code *changes*, so they are much smaller than the original game ROM. This means that you can use git to view the history of a mod, and to merge mods together. It also means that all mods distributed as `.merlon` files are source-available. This is in contrast to other patch formats, such as Star Rod's `.mod`, which distribute mods as binary patches that cannot be viewed or merged.
