Searching Algorithms
======================================

Developers often need to perform searching algorithms on arrays. With this library you can use plenty of different seaching algorithms such as binary search and the selection algorithm.

Binary Search
------------
The following code will find the index of a given number 'num' in an array 'arr' .

`arr`: The array we are searching.
`num`: The integer we are looking for.

>>> from algo_solver import searching as s
index = s.binary_search(arr = [1,5,3,2], num = 3)
print(index)

Selection Algorithm
------------
The following code will find the index of the kth larrgest element in a given array 'arr' .  

`arr`: An array you are searching through. 

>>> from algo_solver import searching as s
index = s.binary_search(arr = [1,5,3,2], num = 3)
print(index)
