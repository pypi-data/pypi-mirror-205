outroText = 'Generate Data Path\n'+18*'-'+'\nMostely, one needs to combine files with different run numbers. These are often sequential and thus making a loop to generate the file path '\
+'is straight forward. However, sometimes one is to combine files differently. This is taken care of with the function _tools.fileListGenerator, which takes a number '\
+'string, a folder, and the year of the data files. From this data files are generated. The number string works by creating paths to all files between and including '\
+'numbers provided like "xx-yy". Adding numbers by comma separation simply appends it. Further, a combination of these two methods is possible. The resulting files from '\
+'above is: \n\n'\

+'Binning\n'+7*'-'+'\nWhen dealing with data that is non-uniformly distributed it is sometimes necessary to have a function that creates suitable bins all containing '\
+' data. This is exactly what the _tools.binEdges does. It starts the first bin starts 0.1 times the tolerance away from the first unique entry and iterates through the list of '\
+'points. For each step, as long as the distance between the current value and the next is less than the tolerance the bin is expanded. If the '\
+'distance is greater, a bin is created in the middle between the last accepted and the rejected point. This insures that all points are within a bin '\
+'and that no bins are empty. For the last point of the list, it is checked if the difference between last bin edge and point is smaller than '\
+'tolerance*1.1 and if so, a bin is created of size tolerance. Otherwise, the las bin edge is 0.1*tolerance away from last point. '\
