Options specified in the configuration files:

[system] section

path: local path where all the ontologies are located and that is used to find ontologies specified using relative paths

subprocess_log: path to file where log outputs of each of the created subprocesses (for theorem provers or model finders) are stored

[prolog] section
swi: command (or complete path) to call SWI Prolog executable (needs to be locally installed)

[active] section
provers: {prover9, vampire} comma-separated set of provers that are used (each one needs to be specified in a separate section with the name used here; see at the end of this documentation)
model_finders: {paradox, mace4} comma-separated set of model finders that are used (each one needs to be specified in a separate section with the name used here; see at the end of this documentation)
If certain theorem provers or model finders are not installed locally, they must be removed from this section.


[converters] section
clif-to-prover9: path to the  executable of the clif-to-prover9 converter (part of Chris Mungall's cltools, needs to be locally installed)

[cl] section
prefix: comma-separated list of URI prefixes to simply ignore
ending: standard ending of Common Logic files

[ladr] section
ending: standard ending of Prover9 input files
folder: subfolder where to store the generated Prover9 input files
all_ending: intermediate ending for compiling a set of Prover9 input files into a single Prover9 input file

[tptp] section
ending: standard ending of TPTP input files
folder: subfolder where to store the generated TPTP input files
all_ending: intermediate ending for compiling a set of TPTP input files into a single TPTP input file

[output] section
folder: subfolder where to store all output files generated by theorem provers and model finders

Theorem Provers and Model Finders

[prover9],[mace4],[vampire],[paradox] section
command: executable (how you would call it on the command line)
ending: standard ending used for the output files
timeout: time in second to allow the prover/finder to use (soft limit)
positive_returncode: comma-separated list of return codes when the prover/finder has returned with a positive result (proved/model found)
unknown_returncode: comma-separate list of return codes when the prover/finder terminated inconclusively
