Macleod updated installation (2014-07-31)


PYTHON
===

check for Python version on Windows: Python27 folder exist in main drive (C:)
if not yet installed, install python
Windows (currently 2.7.8): https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/

Also install "Python for Windows extension" (pywin32) from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/
It has to match your Python installation (either both 32-bit or both 64-bit)

Finally, install the "WMI module", a wrapper for the Python for Windows extension (pywin32) from
http://timgolden.me.uk/python/wmi/index.html


THEOREM PROVERS
===

create folder: C:\Reasoning
place the following three in there:
paradox3.exe
vampire_win.exe
prover9-bin (bin folder of ladr, i.e. prover9-mace4, distribution)


MACLEOD
===

copy the macleod folders conf, pyparsing, src, tasks to some "macleod" directory: C:\Reasoning\macleod

edit C:\Reasoning\macleod\conf\macleod_win.conf
[system] path, subprocess_log
[prover9] command
[mace4] command
[vampire] command
[paradox] command

edit C:\Reasoning\macleod\conf\logging.conf
[handler_fHandler] args=("C:/Reasoning/macleod/log/macleod.log",)
[subprocess_logging] file="C:/Reasoning/macleod/log/macleod_sub.log"
Make sure the directory exists! (You may have to create C:/Reasoning/macleod/log/ first)

edit C:\Reasoning\macleod\src\filemgt.py:
config_dir = 'C:\Reasoning\macleod\conf'

PATH, PYTHONPATH
===

add entries that point to python (e.g. C:\Python27) to PATH and PYTHONPATH to system environment variables (My Computer -> Properties -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables)

add entry that points to macleod (e.g. C:\Reasoning\macleod) to PYTHONPATH

use "echo %PYTHONPATH%" on the commandline to check whether the path is set correctly (should contain both entries)


edit C:\Reasoning\macleod\conf\macleod_win.conf
[cl] prefix
