macleod Installation Instructions
=================================

These instructions are for the revised version of macleod and supersede the instructions in colore-manual.pdf

Requirements:
* 2.6.4 or higher version of Python 2
* Locally installed theorem provers and model finders.  Tested with prover9, mace4, vampire, and paradox3 -- both on Linux and on Windows.
* Installation of cltools to facilitate translation from Common Logic syntax to LADR (Prover9/mace4) syntax. Not needed if prover9 and mace4 are not used.  
Detailed installation instructions for cltools are given in colore-manual.pdf.  


Instructions:
1. Copy the entire project (including at least src, task, conf, pyparsing) into a local directory (e.g. "macleod"; called the macleod directory).
2. Add the macleod directory to your PYTHONPATH variable; make sure you don't overwrite the entry pointing to the default python libraries. 
3. Ensure that the directories that are specified as destination for the log files exist (see logging.conf and macleod_linux.conf or macleod_win.conf in the conf directory).
4. Adapt the configuration file (macleod_linux.conf or macleod_win.conf depending on your system) as explained in conf/config_documentation.txt.
5. The tasks directory contains a set of tasks with self-explanatory names, e.g. to run consistency checks, to prove lemmas, to convert the clif files to other notations (ladr or tptp), etc.
