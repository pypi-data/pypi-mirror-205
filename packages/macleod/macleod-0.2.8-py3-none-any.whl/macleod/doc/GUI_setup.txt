How to Setup The Editor
=============================

Requirements:
- Python 3
- ply (Python Lex & Yacc): 
	- On linux/mac, run "pip install ply" (see below if you have multiple versions of Python installed)
	- On Windows, run "python -m pip install ply"
- PyQt5
	- On linux/mac, run "pip install PyQt5" (see below if you have multiple versions of Python installed)
	- On Windows, run "python -m pip install PyQt5"
	
	
If you have multiple versions of Python on Linux:
-------------------------------------------------
- make sure you use the right python and the right pip
- use "pip -V" to determine the version, if it is not 3.5, install pip3:
"sudo apt-get install python3-pip"
- then run "pip3 install ply" and "pip3 install PyQt5"
-------------------------------------------------

Instructions:
- Follow the "Installation" instructions found in README.md to get the Macleod dependencies
- In your home directory, create a directory called "macleod"
- Copy the appropriate conf files from the "conf" directory to the new "macleod" directory
    - Make sure you get the appropriate conf for your operating system
    - Update logging.conf to point to where you would like to store the logs.
- Install ply. On Linux and Mac, the easiest way to do this is to use pip. Run "pip install ply".
    - If you're on Windows, the PyCharm IDE makes it easy:
        - https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installing-uninstalling-and-upgrading-packages.html
    - If you don't want to use an IDE and you're using Python 3.4 or higher:

    - If you don't want to use an IDE but you're using Python 3.3 or lower:
        - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4750806/how-do-i-install-pip-on-windows
- Install PyQt5. Again using pip, run "pip install PyQt5".
- Navigate to macleod/gui/gui_beta
- Run gui_main.py

Personalization:
- In the gui, access the file menu
- Select "Settings"
- Here you can:
    - Change the root directory. This will change which files are shown in the "Directory" panel
    - Change the highlighter colors. By default they are all black.
