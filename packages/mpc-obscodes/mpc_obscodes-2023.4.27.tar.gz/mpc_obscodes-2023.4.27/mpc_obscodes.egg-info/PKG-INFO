# Minor Planet Center Observatory Codes

This package ships the Minor Planet Center's [file](https://minorplanetcenter.net/Extended_Files/obscodes_extended.json.gz) of observatory codes and their geodetic coordinates.

This is not an official MPC package. It is an automatically generated mirror of the file so that it is 
installable via `pip`.

## Installation

The latest version of the file can be install via pip:  
`pip install mpc_obscodes`

## Usage
```python
import pandas as pd
from mpc_obscodes import mpc_obscodes

obscodes = pd.read_json(mpc_obscodes, orient="index")
```
