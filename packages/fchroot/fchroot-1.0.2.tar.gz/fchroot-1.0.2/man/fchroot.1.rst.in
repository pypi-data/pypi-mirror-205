SYNOPSIS
--------

``fchroot``, also known as "Franken-Chroot" or "Funtoo Chroot", is a utility
that helps you to leverage the magic of QEMU to chroot into a non-native
system. For example, on your x86-compatible 64-bit PC, it is possible to chroot
into a 32-bit or 64-bit foreign architecture root filesystem and have it
actually work.

This is accomplished by leveraging the "binfmt-misc" functionality built-in to
the Linux kernel, combined with QEMU to perform emulation of non-native
instruction sets. ``fchroot`` itself doesn't do any magic except provide a very
easy-to-use mechanism to get this to work, typically requiring little or no
manual configuration. You simply run ``fchroot`` just like ``chroot``, and
everything works.

``fchroot`` currently supports running on an x86-64bit platform, although in
theory there is no reason why it would not work on other architectures -- this
is just not currently tested. ``fchroot`` then allows you to "enter" arm-32bit,
arm-64bit (aarch64), riscv-64bit and powerpc-64bit chroots.
