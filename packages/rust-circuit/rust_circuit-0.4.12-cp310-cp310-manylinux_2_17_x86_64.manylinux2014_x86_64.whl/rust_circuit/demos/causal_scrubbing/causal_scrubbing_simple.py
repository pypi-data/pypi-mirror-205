# ### Doing causal scrubbing: recursively sampling data
#
# Terminology note: in circuits land, including here, we think of our circuit as being a dependency graph
# with arrows from nodes to nodes they depend on. This means that the output is an *ancestor* of the
# input. So, any time you see "parent", this means something closer to the output, and vice versa for "child".
# In the causal scrubbing algorithm, we traverse the interpretation graph from parents to children.
#
# The first thing we do in a causal scrubbing experiment is recursively (starting from the root, i.e. the output)
# sample two new data for each node of our interpretation graph. At each node n_I we have two inputs:
# 1. A source dataset that we can sample from
# 2. A parent datum that constrains our next sample
# And are sampling:
# 1. The new datum, which agrees with the parent datum on the function at n_I
# 2. An "other datum" that will be used for any inputs to this node that are not specified by the correspondence
#
# Normally this would happen behind the scenes in an Experiment, but here we'll walk through it step by step.

# After each recursive sampling step, we'll print out the interpretation. The nodes will be colored
# by the hash of their dataset, and they'll be annotated with the two data we've sampled for them.
# As you run the sampling, verify for yourself that the sampled datum at each node does in fact agree
# on the value of the function at that node with the datum of its parent.

# ### Doing causal scrubbing: replacing inputs to the treeified model

# Recall that in causal scrubbing, we need to treeify our model; but we don't need to treeify it entirely,
# only as much as our hypothesis requires. That is, if our hypothesis says that some nodes need to be sampled
# together, they can stay together.

# In the context of an Experiment, we can call treeified() to perform this rewrite. This finds the paths
# that are picked out by this hypothesis, and wraps the inputs to each with a random tag to uniqueify them.
# This is an algebraic rewrite -- the resulting circuit is extensionally equal -- because we're not actually
# changing any of the inputs.
#
# Treeifying also allows us to run some checks that your correspondence is doing what it says on the tin.
# These checks assert various invariances that aren't otherwise enforced when constructing a Correspondence or
# Experiment, and catch various misleading correspondences that will run but give surprising results.
# We recommend running with treeify=True and check=True to validate your correspondence when you first create it.
#
# Before running the below, try drawing out what the treeified graph will look like on paper.

# %%
# %% [markdown]

# ## Conveniences
#
# The causal scrubbing code provides a number of conveniences to make expressing your hypotheses easier, rather than forcing you
# to manually specify a graph isomorphism between your interpretation and the model.
# %% [markdown]

# ### IterativeMatcher

# Suppose you had the diamond graph (where A is the input and D is the output)
# ```
#   A
#  / \
# B   C
#  \ /
#   D
# ```
# and you wanted to hypothesize that A does some computation and later D uses that information to do something. You might want to
# draw the interpretation `A -> D`; but there is no such edge in the model, so you can't write down a homomorphism c from I to G!
#
# Or, suppose you were analyzing a neural network. You had analyzed the attention heads and thought 0.1 and 2.1 were important while
# no heads in layer 1 were, but you had not yet looked at the MLPs. How would you express the hypothesis that paths from 0.1 to 2.1,
# potentially passing through MLPs but not through layer 1 heads, were important?
#
# In both of these cases, you could rewrite your interpretation with more nodes -- in the first example, adding nodes to your
# interpretation corresponding to B and C. Or, you could do a circuit rewrite to group together some of the nodes in your model.
# Both of these are pretty annoying to do, so instead we allow you to correspond an interpretation node to an IterativeMatcher picking
# out some paths in the model. That is, you can say things like:
# ```
# correspondence.add(a_I, rc.IterativeMatcher("D").chain("A"))
# ```

# %% [markdown]

# ### Implicit extension to inputs

# If you have not explicitly specified an interpretation for some of the paths between c(I) and the inputs, this is filled
# in for you. After all, we have to have inputs for every path through the model! In other words, for every matcher in your
# interp graph, all the inputs upstream of nodes that matcher matches will be replaced. They will be replaced by the interp
# node's `ds` if they are leaves, and its `other_inputs_ds` if they are not (see the next section); some inputs will then be
# replaced again by child interp nodes if they exist.
#
# To do this we have to know what the "inputs" are. The names of the inputs are defined in the dataset you supply to the
# experiment, and are expected to be present in the circuit you pass in.

# %% [markdown]

# ### More on: nodes not in any matched paths
#
# We mentioned briefly earlier that each interpretation node n_I samples a other_inputs_ds. If c(n_I) has children that are not in
# the paths defined by c(children(n_I)), they will be run on this dataset. For instance, in the example we looked at, the input to
# x1 and x2 going into A was drawn from A_primes other_inputs_ds. This allows you to very easily say that "the other
# children don't matter" -- by default, other_inputs_ds is sampled randomly from the source dataset.
#
# But you can also use this in other ways: for example, you can set n_I's cond_sampler to an UncondSampler, and n_I's other_inputs_sampler
# to an ExactSampler, which represents "c(children(n_I)) don't matter, and the other children do matter and can't be resampled at all".
# For example, you can use this to ablate a single path in the model.
#
# ```
# n_I = InterpNode(cond_sampler=UncondSampler(), other_inputs_sampler=ExactSampler(), name="n")
# ```
#
# Sometimes we might call the set `children(c(n_I)) \ c(children(n_I))` the "unimportant" children as a shorthand, even though they
# are not necessarily unimportant. We also sometimes refer to them as "not in the image of c".

# %% [markdown]

# ### Ref ds for extending the graph
#
# When you .evaluate a scrubbed experiment, you only get the output on the circuit that you specified. If the scrubbed
# circuit computes your entire behavior function, you are done. But, if you want to feed the result of your scrubbed circuit into
# a continued behavior function, you should use the reference ds for any computations there, which you can get by reading the
# ScrubbedExperiment.ref_ds field. For example, if the circuit computes logits and you want to compute a loss, you should use the
# reference dataset to get the labels.

# %% [markdown]

# ## Checks
#
# The code performs a number of checks to make sure your correspondence induces well-defined scrubs. For examples, take a look
# at test_hypothesis.py and test_experiment.py. But we'll briefly list out the checks here as well:
#
# - out maps to out
# - in maps to in
# - corr must map every node in the interp graph to something
# - must respect model tree structure: an interp node I is a child of I' iff each path in c(I) is an extension of a path in c(I')
# - each matcher must match something
# - no two matchers can match the same path
# - bonus: after treeifying, no two matchers can match the same node. this should be equivalent to the above.
#
# Most of these won't run if you disable checks on your experiment; but some are mandatory (like the fact that each matcher must
# match something).
# %% [markdown]

# ## Generalization
#
# Our code is also more general than the algorithm we describe in our writeup in a couple of useful ways.
#
# 1. Each interp node, rather than computing a function and sampling data that agree with the parent datum on that function,
# is associated with a sampler. This is convenient for lots of reasons, like generating data on the fly, but is also fundamentally
# more general: you do not have to sample uniformly from a subset of the data!
# 2. The interpretation is not a computational graph. Again, some things are simply more convenient to express as conditional on the
# dataset rather than the outputs of a computational graph--for example, sampling some things together, enforcing agreement on a feature
# the samples for different nodes, phi rewrites. But, conditions are more powerful than agreement on a function; we won't elaborate on
# that here.

# %% [markdown]

# ## Code base components
#
# The causal scrubbing code relies on the following components:
# 1. An `Experiment`, which takes a `Circuit`, a `Dataset`, and a `Correspondence`.
# 2. A `Circuit`, the model we want to interpret
# 3. A `Correspondence` object, which associates `InterpNodes` with `IterativeMatchers`
# 4. `InterpNodes` are associated in a tree structure, where children are created by calling
# `InterpNode().make_decendant()`. Each `InterpNode` has a name (str) and two `CondSamplers`, one
# that is used for it's 'main datum' and one used for the 'other datum'
# 5. `CondSamplers` are objects that implement `sample(ref_datum, dataset) -> new_datum`.
# For instance a `FuncSampler` will sample new_datum from dataset that agrees on a specified function.
# In reality, they do this in a vectorized way from `(ref_dataset, dataset) -> new_dataset`
# but it can be helpful to think one datapoint at a time.
# 6. `IterativeMatcher` which points at a single subcircuit of the model, potentially on a restricted set of paths.
# 7. `Dataset` objects are pretty simple, mostly wrappers around several arrays with some
# convenience functions (e.g. printing). We require that they frozen for hashing.
