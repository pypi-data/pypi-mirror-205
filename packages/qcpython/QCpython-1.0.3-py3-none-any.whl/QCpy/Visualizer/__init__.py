"""
Visualizer

A collection of classes to visualize the quantum circuit

BlochSphere : visualizes the quantum state of a single qubit as a sphere
QSphere : global view of the quantum circuit visualized as a sphere
Statevector : the amplitudes of the quantum circuit visualized as a graph 
Probabilities : the probabilities of each state being measured visualized as a graph
