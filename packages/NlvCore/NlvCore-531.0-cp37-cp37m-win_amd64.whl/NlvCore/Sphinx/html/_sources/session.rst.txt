the popup menu.

Open Session
------------

TBD.


.. _openlog:

Open Log File
-------------

To open a log file and add it to the current session, select :guilabel:`Session | Open`,
then choose the correct schema from the drop down & any preferred log builder and click the
:guilabel:`Open ...` button. A standard :guilabel:`File Open` dialog will appear,
allowing one or more log files to be opened.

A log builder consists of a :ref:`log file pattern theme <logpatterns>` and one or more
:ref:`view pattern themes <viewpatterns>`. When the log file is opened, the log file pattern
is applied, and one view is opened for each listed view pattern. This permits one or more
views to be opened with predefined markers, searches etc. The available log builders
are defined by the schema.

-----------------

Colours and styles in NLV can be stored as a theme. This includes:

* :ref:`trackers`, and

The gallery of available themes can be found at the :guilabel:`Session | Themes` panel.
Themes can be activated, copied, renamed and deleted. Either right click the
theme in the list and choose the appropriate option, or enter the equivalent
keyboard shortcut.
