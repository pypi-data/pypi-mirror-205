Log File
========

:guilabel:`Logfile` nodes in the explorer view define aspects common to all
:doc:`views <views>` of the log file. These are the markers, trackers and timezone
information.


.. _openview:

Open New View
-------------

TBD.


.. _markers:

Markers
-------

Markers are displayed in the margin to the left of a view. Four markers are
available. Their colours and styles can be set using the drop-down lists in the
:guilabel:`Logfile | Markers` panel.

Each line in the log file can be associated with a marker in one of two ways:

* via text matching, or
* explicitly selected

The text matched markers identify marked lines via the search text box. For more
information, see :doc:`searching <searching>`.

Explicitly selected markers identify user chosen lines. In the log view, place 
the cursor in the line to be marked and press the :kbd:`Ctrl-B` key.

.. _trackers:

Trackers
--------

A tracker is a special mark in the view margin which indicates the line 
containing the cursor. There are two types of tracker:

* Local tracker. This tracks a location within a single log file. All views of 
  the logfile show the same tracker at the same line. If the tracker is not
  visible for a view, then it is the case that the corresponding line has been
  filtered out of that view.
* Global trackers. These trackers are common to all views of all logfiles in the 
  session. They identify the **nearest** line in the current view to the tracked 
  line. Correlation of lines in different log files is made by comparing the 
  date/time stamp of the lines.

For more information on how to set the location of a tracker, and how different
views can be set to scroll to keep a tracker displayed on-screen,
see :ref:`Tracking <viewtracking>`.

Tracker colours and styles can be set using the drop-down lists in the 
:guilabel:`Logfile | Trackers` panel.

.. _timezone:

Timezone Info
-------------

Global trackers use log line date/time information to compare locations in
different logfiles. All such caluclations are performed in UTC. Set the timezone
here to allow for offsets between the logfiles in the session.

Themes
------

Logfiles interact with Navigation themes and Log pattern themes.


.. _lognavigation:

Navigation
..........

Any local changes to a marker or tracker colour or style can be saved
or cleared via the :guilabel:`Logfile | Theme | Changes to navigation theme`
panel.

.. image:: markers-theme.png

To change the selected navigation theme, see :ref:`themes`.


.. _logpatterns:

Log Patterns
............

Log pattern themes are the search patterns used to define all of the
markers. A gallery of available themes can be found at
:guilabel:`Logfile | Theme | Log theme gallery`.

.. image:: logfile-theme-gallery.png

Where local changes to a Log pattern theme exist, they can be saved or
cleared via the :guilabel:`Logfile | Theme | Changes to log theme` panel.
