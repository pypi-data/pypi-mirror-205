Schema
======

The type, or **schema**, of a log file is determined by the common **fields** available
on every line in the logfile. The :guilabel:`Session | Open | Log file schema` drop-down
list contains the names of all schemata recognised by the installation. The text
just below this list shows the fields, and their details, for the chosen schema.

Log lines which don't have fields present are termed **irregular**. Not all
searching and filtering will work with irregular lines.

Implementation
--------------

A schema is an XML file, normally distributed as part of a Python NLV extension.
See the MythTV extension for an example.

As well as defining the schema, an extension can define:

* logfile formatting
* :ref:`Log file <logpatterns>` and :ref:`view <viewpatterns>` pattern themes
* logfile builders
* a channel identifier for the notifier

All data used by NLV is in XML format.
