NLV
===

NLV is a viewer tool which supports the analysis of one or more log files in order
to understand why a system behaved in a particular way.

NLV allows multiple views of a log file to be opened. Text and lines of interest within
a view may be hilited, bookmarked and annotated. The log lines presented in a view can be
filtered to display only lines of interest. The filter engine supports regular expressions
and can match on log file fields, as well as bookmarks and annotations.

Lines in different views can be associated so that scrolling in one view automatically
scrolls to the same position in related views. Where the views correspond to different
log files, the association is made via the line's time stamp.

NLV works with 3'rd party IDEs and editors to synchronise display of the source code
which emitted a log line with the NLV view, providing a way to browse the system's source code.
