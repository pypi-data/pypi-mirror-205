vsNLV
=====

vsNLV is a plugin for Visual Studio 2015 or newer. The plugin displays the source
code corresponding to the current log line in NLV. Note that the current implementation
requires that only one instance if Visual Studio is running.

In Visual Studio, 

* Open the Solution containing the source files referenced from the logfile.
  Note that this does not have to be the Solution that built the software, as
  Visual Studio is being used as a source code viewer. In general though,
  IntelliSense will give better results if the Solution can build the software.
 
* If the :guilabel:`NLV Listener` pane is not already open, select the
  :guilabel:`View | Other Windows | NLV Listener` menu item.

* Select a channel from the :guilabel:`Notifier Channel` dropdown.

* In the :guilabel:`Output` panel, select "NLV Listener" from the
  :guilabel:`Show output from` drop down.

In NLV:

* Move the cursor in a view. 

The :guilabel:`Console` pane in NLV will show that a connection to vsNLV
has been established:

Similarly, the :guilabel:`Output` panel in Visual Studio will also show the
connection has been established:

.. image:: vsnlv-output.png

Moving the cursor in NLV will result in the :guilabel:`NLV Listener` pane
displaying the log text and the source code being displayed.
