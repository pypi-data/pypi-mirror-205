files (where `[run-name]` is the name from the settings sheet):
  * `Masses_Vibrio_[run-name].csv`: Data series from the sheet AcquisitionIntervals.
  * `Metadata_[run-name].csv`: Data from the sheet PanelData.
  * `SampleSummary_[run-name].csv`: Data from the sheet IntervalAnalysis plus sample related data from AcquisitionIntervals.
