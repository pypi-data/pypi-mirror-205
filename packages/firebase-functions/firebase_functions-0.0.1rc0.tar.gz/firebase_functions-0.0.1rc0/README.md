# Firebase Functions Python SDK

Welcome GitHub lurker! This repository is a work in progress. It will eventually let users create Cloud Functions for Firebase in Python. This feature is under very early development and not ready for testing. When it is ready, you can get first access by signing up for the [Firebase Alpha Program](https://services.google.cn/fb/forms/firebasealphaprogram/).

While you wait for us to get this feature ready for the public, we'd really appreciate you not blowing this up. Let's keep things on the down low for now. ðŸ¤«
