# wi1-bot

A Discord bot to integrate [Radarr](https://radarr.video/) & [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/), allowing commands like !addmovie and !downloads.

### Usage

1. Copy `config.yaml.template` to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wi1-bot/config.yaml` and set the necessary values.
2. `pip install wi1-bot` (or from source: `pip install git+https://github.com/wthueb/wi1-bot.git`)
3. `wi1-bot`

### Development

1. `git clone https://github.com/wthueb/wi1-bot.git`
2. `cd wi1-bot/`
3. `pip install -e .[dev]`
4. `pre-commit install`

Requires Python >=3.10.

### TODO

- Use Discord slash commands instead of normal text commands (difficult: can't have "conversation" with slash commands)
- Web dashboard for seeing transcode queue, transcode progress, quotas
- Enforce quotas
- !linktmdb
    - !rate / !ratings (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/rate-movie)
    - !movierec based off of ratings and similar-to-user ratings?
        - https://towardsdatascience.com/the-4-recommendation-engines-that-can-predict-your-movie-tastes-109dc4e10c52
        - or just use TMDB's API to get recommendations (if that's possible?)
- !movieinfo showing user/public ratings and other general info (runtime, cast, director)
    - Use TMDB API to get movie metadata
    - If movie isn't on Radarr, react to message to add it?
    - Tautulli API (get_history) to show who has already seen the movie
- User leaderboard
