Overview
========

xmlcoll is a python package for working with collections of items.
The items have heterogeneous data stored as
`properties` in a dictionary with keys given by a
name and optional tags.  The package API has routines to write data to and
retrieve data from `XML <https://www.w3.org/XML/>`_ and to validate that
XML against a schema.
