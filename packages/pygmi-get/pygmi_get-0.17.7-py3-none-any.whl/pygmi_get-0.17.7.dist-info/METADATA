Pygmi
=====

Welcome to Pygmi, a package manager that is completely file-based and
local, so no need to worry about virtual environments and the like.

Installation
------------

Using PIP
~~~~~~~~~

Using PIP is a great way to install Pygmi if you are a beginner and
don't want to have to manage Pygmi yourself. However, PIP installations
are hard to troubleshoot if you run into issues.

1. Run the following command:

.. code:: bash

   pip install pygmi-get

2. Usage:

.. code:: bash

   pygmi-get install PACKAGE_NAME

Using a Local Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using a local installation of Pygmi allows you to manage Pygmi manually,
which makes troubleshooting easier. However, local installations may be
difficult to understand how to use if you are a beginner.

1. Download the repository from GitHub, or use Git or the GitHub CLI to
   clone it.

2. Press Win+R and run the following command:

.. code:: bash

   rundll32 sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables

3.  A window will open showing environment variables.

4.  Select "Path" and press "Edit".

5.  Click "New" and enter the full non-relative path to your
    installation.

6.  Press the Enter key.

7.  Press OK until you exit the window.

8.  Open any Code Editor that has a built-in terminal.

9.  Open the folder containing your installation.

10. Run the following command:

.. code:: bash

   py setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

11. Run the following command:

.. code:: bash

   pip install dist/SOME_NAME_HERE.whl

Troubleshooting
---------------

"pygmi-get" is not a cmdlet?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Is your installation of pygmi-get installed locally?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Add it to your PATH variable, and then build it using the following
   command:

.. code:: bash

   py setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

2. Then, install it using the following command:

.. code:: bash

   pip install dist/SOME_NAME_HERE.whl
