# Roulettes
This little thing builded by Ivulka allows you to build your own roulettes in python! It provides the mechanism to generate random pick between items with chances.

## How to use?
First, you need to use `pip install roulettes` in terminal. Now you can use roulettes.

### Usage
This package is very simple but I think it's sufficient. It has only one function with only one argument: `roulette(<content>)` <br><br>
How to use it? Okay, first think you need to know it returns the genrated value so you must use it like this: `x = roulette(<content>)` <br><br>
The argument is the content of the roulette. You can save it to a variable if you don't want to have a long code. It's structure is this:
``` python
[
  {
    'item': <item name>,
    'chance': <chance>
  },
  {
    'item': <item name>,
    'chance': <chance>
  } ...
]
```
Note the chance don't must be in a percentage so it's easier to calculate.

### Example
This is an example of a code that works:
``` python
import roulettes

some_roulette = [
{'item': '100$', 'chance': 1},
{'item': '50$', 'chance': 2},
]

money = 10000

reward = roulettes.roulette(some_roulette)
if reward == '100$':
  money += 100
elif reward == '50$':
  money += 50
print(f'{money}$')
```
