It also ensures legal rest periods are included if you forgot to track them.\n\nIn the Harry Potter series, the Time-Turner is a magical device that allows the user to travel back in time. Time Turner is a time tracker that lets you "turn back time" and record activities from the past.\n\n**Warning, this is still an alpha release, the API is not stable yet.**\n\n## Usage\n\n### Starting an Activity\n\nTo start tracking an activity, run the following command:\n\n\n![`timeturner add`](img/add.svg)\n\nThis will record the current time as the start of your activity.\n\nIf you forgot to start tracking an activity yesterday, you can provide the start time with an additional parameter, `-10m` would mean 10 minutest ago. The full list of possible time values can be [seen further down](#examples-for-times)\n\n### Stopping an Activity\n\nTo stop tracking the current activity, run the following command:\n\n\n![`timeturner end`](img/end.svg)\n\n\nThis will record the current time as the end of your activity and calculate the total duration.\n\n### Adding a Past Activity\n\nIf you forgot to track an activity in the past, you can add it with `timeturner add <start_time> - <end_time>`\n\n![`timeturner add -- -1d@9:00 - +8h45m`](img/add_past.svg)\n\n### Adding a public holiday\n\nTo add May 1st as a public holiday, run the following command:\n\n![`timeturner add 05-01 @holiday`](img/add_holiday.svg)\n\n### Adding your vacation\n\nTo add your vacation, run the following command:\n\n![`timeturner add 04-25 - 05-14 @vacation`](img/add_vacation.svg)\n\nAdding your vacation will add a segments that are not part of holidays, it will also split\nweekends and only add working days as vacation.\n\n\n\n\n## Configuration\n\n| Environment Variable       | Default Value                    | Description                                  |\n| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| TIMETURNER_CONFIG_HOME     | ~/$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/timeturner    | The directory for configuration files.       |\n| TIMETURNER_CONFIG_FILE     | timeturner.toml                  | The configuration file to use.               |\n| TIMETURNER_DATABASE__HOME  | value of $TIMETURNER_CONFIG_HOME | The directory to store the database file in. |\n| TIMETURNER_DATABASE__FILE  | timeturner.db                    | The database file to use.                    |\n| TIMETURNER_DATABASE__TABLE | pensive                          | The table to use in the database.            |\n\n## Examples\n\n### Examples for times\n\n<start_time> or <end_time> could be one of the following Examples:\n\n| Example         | Description                               |\n| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |\n|                 | now                                       |\n| 9:00            | 9:00 today                                |\n| -1m             | 1 minute ago                              |\n| -1h             | 1 hour ago                                |\n| -1d             | 1 day ago, you will be asked for the time |\n| -1d@9:00        | 1 day ago 9:00                            |\n| +1m             | 1 minute from now                         |\n| +1h             | 1 hour from now                           |\n| 12 7:00         | 7:00 on the 12th of the current month     |\n| 02-28 9:00      | 9:00 on February 28 of the current year   |\n| 2022-02-28 9:00 | 9:00 on February 28, 2022                 |\n\n\n\n### Automatic Rest Periods\n\nIf you forget to track a rest period, the time tracker will reduce the required rest period before showing it. For periods greater than 4h 15 are reducted, for periods greater than 6:15 additional 30m are reducted.\n\n\n\nTODOs:\n- [ ] Add Configuration\n  - [ ] ignore seconds\n  - [ ] freeze time, to generate useful and pretty images for docs\n  - [ ] automatic rest periods\n  - [ ] default work time\n  - [ ] default work week days\n- [ ] allow full day activities to coexist with other activities\n  - [ ] travel time and holiday could happen\n- [ ] DB migrations\n- [ ] show and generate tui output\n- [ ] Add section about contributions\n- [ ] Add precommit hook to ensure code is formatted\n- [ ] Generate docstrings for DB methods\n- [ ] Remove import command (it contains assumptions that will not be true for everyone)\n  - [ ] Document how to import data from other time trackers\n  - [ ] Add mode to convert hamster output to jsonl file.\n  - [ ] Add mode to import jsonl file\n- [ ] Add logging\n  - [ ] allow different log levels for database and application\n- [ ] add test that the last release version in Changelog is the same as in pyproject.toml and app\n- [ ] README\n  - [ ] auto generate config options\n\n\nTODOS by command:\n\n- [x] add\n\n- [ ] end\n  - [ ] add tests\n\n- [ ] configure\n  - [ ] modify and write configfile\n  - [ ] allow to add aliases for commands\n    - [ ] e.g. new new add alias with setting passive to true\n  - [ ] add test when holiday tag name is changed in settings\n\n- [ ] list\n  - [ ] split up multiday activities\n  - [ ] summaries full day tags differently\n  - [x] holidays should not count as work time\n    - [x] it should also not count as missing work time\n  - [ ] group by year, month, week, daysplit up multiday activities\n  - [ ] add option to show only open activities\n  - [ ] add tests\n\n- [ ] import holidays\n\n- [ ] export\n  - [ ] probably like list --format jsonl\n\n- [ ] undo (revert the last change)\n- [ ] confirm changes that would modify other entries\n\n### Design Goals\n\n- minimalistic, little to type\n- enforce as little as possible\n- be clear\n- be extensible\n  - TODO: support plugins (maybe a later version)\n  - be able to use it programmatically\n  - be able to use it as a library\n\n\n### Open Questions\n\n- [ ] should the get_latest_segment return segments from the future (start_time in the future)?\n\n### Nice to have:\n- [ ] Build a minimal Docker image (maybe)\n- [ ] https://github.com/ines/termynal\n',
