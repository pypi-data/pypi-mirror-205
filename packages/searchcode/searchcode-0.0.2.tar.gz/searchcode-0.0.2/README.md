This is a dummy package managed by the developer of the SearchCode API wrapper to prevent name squatting. The official name of PyPIâ€™s SearchCode API wrapper Python package is searchcode-cli. This package ensures that if you type `pip install searchcode` by mistake you will end up with `searchcode-cli`.
