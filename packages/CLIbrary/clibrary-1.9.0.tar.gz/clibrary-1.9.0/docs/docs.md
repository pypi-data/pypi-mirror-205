## Introduction

### CLIbrary

**CLIbrary** is *a comprehensive Python library of standard CLI utilities for convenient command, I/O, and file handling*. This means it is a set of functions that simplifies writing programs based on it by providing a coherent environment.

**CLIbrary** provides functions to:
* Manage a CLI interface through command-and-options handling.
* Easily access to the program's *help*.
* Seamlessly load and dump informations to files.
* Handle various type of inputs without having to worry about consistency and errors.
* Output different type of informations such as errors and warnings.

**CLIbrary** is written in Python and developed by [Andrea Di Antonio](https://github.com/diantonioandrea).

### Handlers

Handlers play an important role inside **CLIbrary**.
Every function accepts only a handler which is a dictionary structured as {"option": value}.

Note that, although every function has a default handler, it is recommended to provide at least some options to achieve a better user experience.

### Settings

As of version 1.2.1, CLIbrary has some "global options" to allow even more personalization.  
Available options are:

1. `CLIbrary.style.setting_darkMode`, bool: Enables global dark mode. Dafault: `False`.
2. `CLIbrary.style.setting_plainMode`, bool: Disables styling. Default: `False`.
3. `CLIbrary.style.setting_caseSensitive`, bool: Enables case-sensitiveness. Default: `False`.
4. `CLIbrary.data.setting_fileExtension`, str: Defines a file extension for *CLIbrary.aDump* and *CLIbrary.aLoad*. Default: `".pickle"`
5. `CLIbrary.commands.setting_enableCompletion`, bool: Enables command completion. Default: `True`

### Import CLIbrary

**CLIbrary** can be installed by:

	python3 -m pip install --upgrade CLIbrary

verified by:

	python3 -m CLIbrary
	
imported by:

``` python
import CLIbrary
```

and all the functions can be accessed by:

``` python
CLIbrary.FUNCTION_NAME()
```

## Interface

[Go back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### CLI

``` python
CLIbrary.cmdIn(commandHandler: dict = {}) -> dict
```

*cmdIn* stands for *Command Input* as this function allows the user to input command as in a CLI interface.  
As of version 1.9.0, CLIbrary supports tab completion and hinting thanks to [cmdInput](#cmdinput).

The handler for this function makes use of the following parameters:
* request, str: The prompt to the user.
* added, str: A set of characters to be automatically added to the prompt. Default is ": ".
* style, str[^1]: A particular colour style to be applied to the prompt.
* verbose, bool.
* allowedCommands, list: A list of all the allowed commands for the CLI interface.
* helpPath, str: The path to the help JSON. This enables the *help* command.

This function returns a dictionary with the following keys:
* command, str: The command.
* sdOpts, dict: A dictionary containing single-dash options as {"opts1": "value1", "opts2": "value2", ...}[^2].
* ddOpts, list: A list containing double-dash options as [opts1, opts2, ...][^2].

Commands are always structured as:

	command -sdOpt value --ddOpt

with no more than a single word for the command itself.

[^1]: Colorama styling works best for styling inside **CLIbrary**.

[^2]: The options get returned without the dashes.

### cmdInput

``` python
CLIbrary.interface.cmdInput(handler: dict) -> None
```

*cmdInput* is cmdIn's alternative to Python's input which allows for tab completion and hinting.
There's no need to call this function manually as its calls are embedded inside *cmdIn*.

### Option parser

``` python
CLIbrary.interface.optionParser(instructions: list) -> None
```

*optionParser* is a function that receives a list of strings and returns the single dash options sdOpts, a dictionary, and the double dash options, a list.
There's no need to call this function manually as its calls are embedded inside *cmdIn*.

### Help

``` python
CLIbrary.interface.helpPrint(handler: dict) -> None
```

*helpPrint* is a function that reads and print the help JSON whose path gets passed to *cmdIn*.
There's no need to call this function manually as its calls are embedded inside *cmdIn*.

### Help entries

A help entry must be formatted this way:

``` json
"command": {
	"description": "Command description.",
	"options": {"-sdOpt#": "VALUE_DESCRIPTION", "-sdOpt": "VALUE_DESCRIPTION", "--ddOpt": ""}
}
```

where mandatory options get identified by a "#" and double-dash options don't require a value description.

This is an example from **openBriefcase**'s accounts help JSON[^3]:

``` json
{
	"exit": {
		"description": "Exits the account environment."
	},
	"new": {
		"description": "Creates a new movement."
	},
	"edit": {
		"description": "Edits a movement's features specifying at least an attribute.",
		"options": {"-q#": "MOVEMENT_QUERY", "--reason": "", "--amount": "", "--date": "", "--category": ""}
	},
	"remove": {
		"description": "Removes a movement.",
		"options": {"-c#": "MOVEMENT_QUERY"}
	},
	"summary": {
		"description": "Prints a summary of the account's movements."
	},
	"load": {
		"description": "Loads a set of movements from a file."
	},
	"dump": {
		"description": "Dumps a set of movements to a file.",
		"options": {"-s": "STARTING_TIME", "-e": "ENDING_TIME"}
	}
}

```

[^3]: This example refers to the version 1.5.0 of openBriefcase. The updated file can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/diantonioandrea/openBriefcase/blob/main/resources/openBriefcaseAccountHelp.json).

## Files

[Go back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

**CLIbrary** provides two functions to handle files loading and dumping: *aLoad* and *aDump*. These functions make a great use of the Python module Pickle.

### Dumping

``` python
CLIbrary.aDump(fileHandler: dict) -> None
```
