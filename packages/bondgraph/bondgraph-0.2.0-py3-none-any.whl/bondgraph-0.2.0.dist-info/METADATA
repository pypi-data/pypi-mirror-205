# bondgraph
A python library for creating [bond graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_graph) of 
physical systems and generating differential equations.

It heavily relies on `sympy` for manipulation and simplification of equations symbolically.

## Installation
Install via pip:
```
pip install bondgraph
```

To install with extra dependencies for visualization using graphviz:
```
pip install bondgraph[visualization]
``` 

## Usage
Create a `BondGraph` object and add `Bond` objects connecting various elements:
```python
# This example generates the following simple bond graph:
#
# Se ---> 1 ---> I
#         |
#         v
#         R

from bondgraph.core import Bond, BondGraph
from bondgraph.junctions import JunctionEqualFlow
from bondgraph.elements import Element_R, Element_I, Source_effort
from sympy import Symbol

force = Source_effort("force", Symbol("F"))
friction = Element_R("friction", Symbol("k_f"))
inertia = Element_I("inertia", Symbol("m"), Symbol("p"))
mass_object = JunctionEqualFlow("mass_object")

graph = BondGraph()
graph.add(Bond(force, mass_object))
graph.add(Bond(mass_object, friction))
graph.add(Bond(mass_object, inertia))

state_equations = graph.get_state_equations()

# Print the dictionary of state variables and the right hand side of their state equations:
print(state_equations)
# {p: F - k_f*p/m}

# If using the optional visualization features, generate and display a graphviz graph:
from bondgraph.visualization import gen_graphviz

output_graph = gen_graphviz(graph)
output.view()
```

## Limitations
- Algebraic loops are not handled at all and will result in failure to generate equations.
- Non-integrating (differential) causality for C or I elements is not currently possible.
