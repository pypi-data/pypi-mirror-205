* Copies photos from the input path to the output path.

* Creates a thumbnail for each photo using the 
[Thumbnail()](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.thumbnail) 
method from Pillow.
  * The thumbnail is created using the dimensions specified in the documentation above.
  * The thumbnail is saved with the same name as the original photo with the addition of the .thumb extension.
* Function uses threading to process photos in parallel. 
  * **__NOTE: This may cause issues with memory usage as thread limits are not implemented in this version \
  be careful how many photos you give it!__**
