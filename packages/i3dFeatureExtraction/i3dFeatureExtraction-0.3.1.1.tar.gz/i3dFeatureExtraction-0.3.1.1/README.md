# I3D_Feature_Extraction
Hello, I am Hao Vy Phan. I have develop this package using ResNet-50 to convert a video into an extracted i3D features numpy file.

## Overview
**Input**: a directory which store 1 or more videos.

**Output**: 1 or many `.npy` files (extracted i3D features). Each features file is shaped `n/16 * 2048` where `n` is the number of frames in the video

If there is a problem installing or implementing this package, please do not hesitate to contact me via my email. I am pleased to have people use my product.

## Usage

### Installation
Before installing my package, please install these pakages:
* [Opencv-Python==4.5.5](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#opencv)
* [torch==1.10.1+cu113](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113/torch-1.10.1%2Bcu113-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl)
* [torchaudio==0.10.1+cu113](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113/torchaudio-0.10.1%2Bcu113-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl)
* [torchvision==0.11.2+cu113](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113/torchvision-0.11.2%2Bcu113-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl)
* Or find your own python OS version of torch from this link: https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113/torch_stable.html

Installing them through `pip install` may raise errors. You can download the wheel files from the above links and run this code: 
```commandline
pip install torchvision-0.11.2+cu113-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
pip install torchaudio-0.10.1+cu113-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
pip install torch-1.10.1+cu113-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
pip install opencv_python-4.5.5-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
```

After 4 above packages, to install `i3dFeatureExtraction` package into your Python environment, run this code on your terminal:
```commandline
pip install i3dFeatureExtraction
```
Or install a specific version:
```commandline
pip install i3dFeatureExtraction==0.2.4
```

### Implementing
The main function of this package is `FeatureExtraction` which converts a directory of videos into numpy feature files.

```Python
from i3dFeatureExtraction import FeatureExtraction
FeatureExtraction.generate(
    datasetpath="directory/of/input/videos",
    outputpath = "directory/to/store/output/numpy/files",
    pretrainedpath = "path/to/i3D/pretrained/weight",
    sample_mode = "oversample/center_crop"
    multiplefiles = True/False
)
```
* **datasetpath** (REQUIRED): path to videos.
* If **multiplefiles** is _True_ (default), the **datasetpath** is the path to a directory which contains 1 or more videos.
* If **multiplefiles** is _False_, the **datasetpath** is the path to a video.
* **outputpath** (optional, default: *"output/"*): the proccessed numpy feature files would be stored in this directory.
* **pretrainedpath** (optional, default: *"pretrained/"*): the path of the pretrained i3d weight. If the weight is not existed, it will be downloaded and created manually.
* **sample_mode** (optional, default: *"oversample/"*) receive "oversample" or "center_crop". If *oversample*, each frame will be cropped and flipped to be turned into 10 frames.
